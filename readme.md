# Network Wide Search

This plugin provides a light-weight implementation of network wide search for WordPress Multisite.

*Features*

* Limit search to certain post types in Network Admin -> Settings -> Network Search.
* Uses MySQL Full-Text Search functionality for relevancy, etc (hey ... I said it was a light implementation for search).
* Adjusts search mode based on string being searched with.

## Possible things down the road

* I'd like to make improvements on relevancy eventually.  If you want to help on this, then please [get in touch](https://www.mattwalters.net/contact/).
